# ProgrammingLanguage-UW
My Learning Record of Coursera Course - Programming Language provided by UW

Course link can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages) <br>

Notice the whole course has been seperated into **three parts**, the link above is just the first part(Part A) of this course. Subsequent course info will be updated when I start to take these courses.

## This repo contains...
* Official **homework** and **lecture note** for each week
* My **homework solution** and **peer review assessment** for each week

## Attention
if you are taking this course now, **do not copy paste** the code from my solution directly, you will learn more by trying your best to finish all the homeworks.
